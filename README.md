# Large-Retail-Store-Management-System
The management of a large retail store would like a database to keep track of sales 
activities:
• Each customer has one job title but different customers may have the same job title. 
• Each customer may place many orders but a particular order is customer specific. 
• Each department has many salespeople but each salesperson must work in only one 
department. 
• Each department has many items to be sold but an item is associated to a single 
department.
• For each order, items ordered in different departments must involve different 
salespeople.
